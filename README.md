# Fancy Forms proof of concept

This is a proof of concept for a form builder library that satisfies the following requirements:

- a form can collect data into a proper custom type
- only one msg/model field for the whole form
- custom, reusable "3rd party" input widgets can be created without forking the lib

# Demo

Just clone and open `index.html`
